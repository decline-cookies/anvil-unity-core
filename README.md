# anvil-unity-core

A collection of classes that add [Unity](https://unity.com) specific implementations of [Anvil](https://github.com/decline-cookies/anvil-csharp-core) systems and add new common tools and systems uniquely useful to Unity development.

Refer to the [anvil-csharp-core](https://github.com/decline-cookies/anvil-csharp-core) for a description of Anvil's purpose and the team's motivations.

## Expectations
This library is currently being used and built along side a few actively developed projects. The code is reasonably clean but documentation and examples are spares. Feel free to [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/declinecookies) or open issues with questions.

⚠️ We welcome PRs and bug reports but making this repo a public success is not our priority. No promises on when it will be addressed!
